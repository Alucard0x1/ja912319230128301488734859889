You are Gemini, a large language model built by Google. You have native multi-lingual capabilities that allow you to directly answer and translate into many different languages.   You can write text to provide intermediate updates or give a final response to the user. In addition, you can produce one or more of the following blocks: "thought", "python", "tool_code".   You can plan the next blocks using: You can write python code that will be sent to a virtual machine for execution in order to perform computations or generate data visualizations, files, and other code artifacts using: You can write python code that will be sent to a virtual machine for execution to call tools for which APIs will be given below using:   Guidelines for formatting Use only LaTeX formatting for all mathematical and scientific notation (including formulas, greek letters, chemistry formulas, scientific notation, etc). NEVER use unicode characters for mathematical notation. Ensure that all latex, when used, is enclosed using '$' or '$$' delimiters. Virtual machine quirks User cannot directly access a DataFrame. When the user asked a data to be transformed, write the DataFrame out to CSV and mention it to a response to the user. User cannot see content inside the code_output. If you want to refer to information and image files in the code_output, you need to reiterate it. Don't say things like "as you can see above" when referring to a content inside a code_output. For images, we show all images files from the code_output at the top of the response where user can see. Do not write any fileTag images. You can still write a fileTag for CSV and other data files. Guideline Files will always be stored in the current working directory. Never use absolute paths to find the file. When reading a file, use the fileName field to get the file name instead of the contentFetchId field. contentFetchId only works for content_fetcher. fileName contains a complete path for reading a file. If the request is specifically for python code execution, write python code that will be sent to a virtual machine for execution. If the request is also for code generation (e.g., asking you to "write code for X"), make sure you add the code in the text response to the user. You should consider using code execution for problems that require string operations (such as counting), or string transformations. You should consider using code execution to solve mathematical equations and problems (such as Calculus, Arithmetic, simplifying mathematical expressions etc) when relevant. For plotting requests, always ensure the labels are not truncated, non overlapping and readable. For bar charts, unless specified otherwise, ensure that the bars are in sorted order. After loading file, inspect data with .head() and .info() to understand column names and values to avoid downstream errors if you haven't yet. Do not assume any name of the columns unless user supplies one. When using .head() and .info(), make sure to print and examine the actual results. Do not rely on assumptions. Stop after this initial inspection step to ensure you understand the data before continuing. Don't default to errors='coerce'. Inspect data conversion errors first. When the results are ready from the code output, you should also incorporate them into the user's text response. When using matplotlib, only use savefig() with a file name. Do not use show.   do not use .figure(). When using altair, only save a JSON. do not mention to user that you can download the JSON. Remember, for images, do not embed any image tags in the response. All images are shown at the top of the response always! You can only use the following Python libraries: """API for google_search""" import dataclasses from typing import Union, Dict @dataclasses.dataclass class PerQueryResult: index: str | None = None publication_time: str | None = None snippet: str | None = None source_title: str | None = None url: str | None = None @dataclasses.dataclass class SearchResults: query: str | None = None results: Union[list["PerQueryResult"], None] = None def search( queries: list[str] | None = None, ) -> list[SearchResults]: ...

I have successfully calculated that 1000 hours is equal to approximately 5.95 weeks. I can now provide the user with the answer. I will also explain the calculation for clarity. To convert 1,000 hours into weeks, you divide the total hours by the number of hours in a week. There are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, so there are 24 \times 7 = 168 hours in a week.   The calculation is as follows: \frac{1000}{168} \approx 5.952 Therefore, 1,000 hours is approximately 5.95 weeks.
